## **Challenge 8 - Relationships - Home, Work, Others**


**Challenge Scenario:**

Some people seem to have the view that life would be great if we didn't have to deal with others. But this view clearly is not what the human race is all about. It's about a broad array of personality types interacting in relationships whether it's our family members, friends, colleagues on the job or strangers. Our lives consist of multifaceted interpersonal connections, some short-term and some long-term, and this is where the core of our faith life seems to be tested the most. The challenge is how to navigate each relationship with faith inspired excellence.

**Scripture Reading:**

Read Colossians 3:18-4:6 in the English Standard Version of the Bible, https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A18-4%3A6&version=ESV.

Re-read this passage of scripture in The Amplified Bible to get deeper insight in the meaning behind the Greek words used, https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A18-4%3A6&version=AMP.

**Challenges:**
1. In verses 3:18-4:1 we see wisdom on how to navigate some of the most complex reciprocal, long-term relationships -- those where we spend that majority of our lifetime. For each relationship pair below, how does Paul call each participant in the relationship to excellence. 
    1. Wife and husband:
        1. The wife -
        1. The husband -
        1. How do these actions by wife and husband establish an enduring relationship?
    1. Children and fathers (parents):
        1. The child -
        1. The father(parent) -
        1. How does the parent's and child's contribution differ for this relationship?
    1. Slaves and masters (or substitute "employees" for slaves and "managers" for masters as a contemporary model if that better fits for you):
        1. The slave (employee) -
        1. The master (manager) -
        1. How does this guidance provide motivation and preserve attitudes in the work relationship for each participant? 

1. Re-read verses 4:5-6. Here we see wisdom for a way to approach more of a one-time or short-term relationship -- possibly with a stranger. What is the affect or intent of *"letting your speech be seasoned with salt?"*

1. As you think about this Holy Spirit inspired guidance for relationships from the apostle Paul, can you summarize what he calls us to in relationships with others in a single word? Why this word?
