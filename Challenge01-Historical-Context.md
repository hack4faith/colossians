## **Challenge 1 - Historical Context**

**Introduction:**

Just like when you write an email to someone, that email has a purpose to communicate a specific message. In the same way, every letter (epistle) in the New Testament exists for a specific purpose (occasion) to address specific issues that its readers were facing in their day-to-day life and faith.

**Challenge Scenario:**

You've started to read the book of Colossians and you've never read it before or you have read it but now you want to get some background on what was the purpose for this letter? What was the city like historically and culturally at the time of this writing? What were the big issues facing the believers that the apostle Paul is seeking to help them with? What false teachings does this letter specifically address?
