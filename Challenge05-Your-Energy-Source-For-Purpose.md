## **Challenge 5 - Your Energy Source for Purpose**


**Challenge Scenario:**

When we want to better visualize or conceptualize something we typically create a model. Whether it's a logical, physical, or mathematical model, it is meant to help us to understand, define, quantify and predict or simulate behavior. By referring to a model we can better examine, evaluate and discuss the object or concept with others. In our faith life, we too need models to help us examine and evaluate what a life lived out in faith looks like. For this challenge let's look at the apostle Paul as a model, essentially someone that has been there, done that and succeeded.  Just what is it that can motivate and empower a life of faith and purpose for a lifetime?

**Scripture Reading:**

Read Colossians 1:24-29 in "The Message" Bible version. https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+1%3A24-29&version=MSG 

**Challenges:**
1. Do a web search on "Christians suffering around the world." List 4 or more types of suffering being experienced by your fellow believers.

1. The context here is that the apostle Paul is in jail in Rome awaiting trial. He was accused by Jewish religious leaders to have broken a number of religious laws (which he had not) and the Jewish leadership wanted to put him to death. To get a fair trial, Paul appealed to Caesar because although he was a Jew it was his right having also been born a Roman citizen. (Optional reading: Acts 21-26)

    In the passage for this challenge, Paul writes, *"There’s a lot of suffering to be entered into in this world — the kind of suffering Christ takes on. I welcome the chance to take my share in the church’s part of that suffering."*

    What do you think the apostle Paul wants his readers to consider about suffering and its part in the life of faith?

1. From verses 26-29, develop a model from the testimony of the apostle Paul along the following dimensions. What do you see as his:
    - Motivation?
    - Purpose?
    - Message?
    - Energy source? 

1. Now that you have a model that helps predict or simulate behavior. Choose one of your real-world, faith-challenging situations from above and work through how your model would respond to that situation across these dimensions motivation, purpose, message and energy source.
