## **Challenge 9 - Standing Mature and Fully Confident**


**Challenge Scenario:**

To be spoken well of to others by a respected colleague or dear friend is one of the highest tributes we can receive. To have the sense of being valued and trusted can instill a confidence within that is beyond what we could muster on our own. But how do we nurture friendships like this? What difference does it make if a friend believes in us or we choose to invest our belief in a friend? How do friendships coupled with prayer shape a mutual unwavering maturity in faith and encourage confidence to walk toward all that God may have for us to do?

**Scripture Reading:**

Read Colossians 4:7-18 in the Message Bible, https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+4%3A7-4%3A18&version=MSG  

**Challenges:**
1. Review all the names called out by the apostle Paul and what he says about each. Choose any three and write what you observe about the depth of each friendship. 
    1. Name One:
    1. Name Two:
    1. Name Three:

1. From your above observations, what do you propose were the key elements that may have knit each of these friendships together so tightly?

1. Epaphras, (you met him in chapter 1:5-8), has a number of things spoken about him by his respected colleague and dear friend, Paul.
    1. What do you see about the character and nature of Epaphras?
    1. Put yourself in the sandals of Epaphras and you have just read these words that Paul has written about you, how might these words impact your life in the present and shape it for the future?
     
1. From within your sphere of interpersonal connections, prayerfully consider two people (there certainly may be more over time, but two for now) where in the next three months you would like to  begin to nurture a friendship that contains the elements you described in 2.
    1. Who are these two?
    1. What steps can you take to reach out to these friends (whether in-person or virtual)?
