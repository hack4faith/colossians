## **Challenge 4 - The Job Description for a Savior**


**Challenge Scenario:**

When we think about some of the most powerful and highly responsible positions on the planet, we think of CEOs of global corporations, presidents, prime ministers, and of course kings and queens. Each of these, along with every other position one can hold in the workplace, can be characterized with a job description that details the role with its responsibilities, required competencies and qualifications to successfully do the job. But there's a job description that we don't typically ponder and that one is -- what would be the job description for the Savior of the world?

**Scripture Reading:**

Read Colossians 1:15-23 in The Amplified Bible version https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians+1%3A15-23&version=AMP  

**Challenges:**
1. Make a quick review of a job description at a director-level role for any global corporation and use it as an example for your responses below. Or, here's a link to one for quick reference, https://github.com/hack4faith/colossians/blob/main/docs/Job%20Description%20-%20Example.pdf. Using verses 15-20 in the Bible verse link above for reference, create a job description for the Savior of the world.  
    1. Write a description for this **Role**. (You may want to write your responses to 1.2 and 1.3 first and then write this as a summary of those.)
    1. List the specific **Responsibilities** and required competencies.
    1. List the **Qualifications** needed to fulfill this role.

1. In verses 21-23, the one who fills your above job description, now wants to present you to His Father. As he presents you to His Heavenly Father (and yours) the following three words describe you? Using the Interlinear resource, https://biblehub.com/interlinear/colossians/1-22.htm, look up the Greek word definition for each below and then write what it means to you to be presented to your Heavenly Father as:
    1. Holy (40):
    1. Unblemished (299):
    1. Blameless (410):
