## **Challenge 7 - Put Off - Put On**


**Challenge Scenario:**

It seems as though we all enjoy a good shopping spree for some new clothes -- especially if someone else is buying! The clothes we wear become too small, faded, threadbare and are no longer suitable for us. So when we do acquire new clothes we can't wait to put off the old ones, set them aside, and put on the new. Likewise, our lives have an old nature -- one that needs to be set aside because it's no longer suitable for us. A new nature has been purchased that we can put on. The challenge for us is a transparent, honest assessment of what needs to be put off and what's available to be put on.

**Scripture Reading:**

Read Colossians 2:16-3:17 in the English Standard Version of the Bible, https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+2%3A16-3%3A17&version=ESV
