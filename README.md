## ** Background and Inspiration for #Hack4Faith and #YourFaith2Action

**#Hack4Faith** and **#YourFaith2Action** were conceived after retirement from the world's largest software company. As a technical professional involved with training other technical professionals, we discovered over the years that the most engaging training experiences were where we provided challenge-based learning opportunities for our technical staff rather than simply step-by-step guidance. Whether for individuals or teams, this challenge-based approach coupled with "hacks" to quickly prove out technical concepts or build prototypes, became a solid model for learning.

Hence, as a person of faith desiring to see others deepen their faith and love for our Lord Jesus Christ, this challenged-based **#Hack4Faith** and **#YourFaith2Action** Bible study format was developed. The **#Hack4Faith** and **#YourFaith2Action** format does not teach, it sets up a series of challenges to hack and provides the Holy Spirit the opportunity to teach and inspire the faith of each person. 

The challenge-based **#Hack4Faith** Bible study format:
1. Shapes study challenges around faith-enabling scenarios
1. Provides links to free online Bible study resources for discovery
1. Challenges learners to make 4 statements from each study to continually build-up their faith
1. Encourages learners to prayerfully determine at least 2 **#YourFaith2Action** deeds as an outcome of their study

**Scriptural Foundation:**

James 2:18-20 -- *"But someone will say, 'You have faith [think **#Hack4Faith**], and I have works [think **#YourFaith2Action**].' Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe -- and tremble! But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead (useless)."*

**#Hack4Faith** and **#YourFaith2Action** couple these truths from James as an emphasis and outcome from the study of God's word. Study of His word produces faith, because, *"…faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of Christ,"* Romans 10:17. Then, as faith is built it must be converted into actions/good works. As Ephesians 2:10 states, *"We are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them."*

**Learning Objectives:**
- Through participation in a **#Hack4Faith** challenge a faith hacker will:
    - Discover Bible study resources available for free on the Internet
    - Experience how to use online Bible study resources
    - Prayerfully contemplate their insights from the challenges and journal their thoughts
    - Share their thoughts with others in a team meet-up whether in-person or virtual
    - Convert **#YourFaith2Action** in practical ways

The challenge-based hack format is certainly free for all to use, but **#Hack4Faith** and **#YourFaith2Action** studies/content created according to this format are intended to be open source, *not to be* monetized in any way, and should only make use of free web-based Bible study resources to be available to all. God's Word is free -- and the Holy Spirit teaches us without cost because Jesus paid the price for His tutelage. Jesus said in Matthew 10:8, *"…Freely you have received; freely give."* **#Hack4Faith** and **#YourFaith2Action** are heart-aligned with these words.
