## **Online Bible Study Tools**

There's a wealth of Bible study tools in hard copy that can be purchased and many of these same resources are available online and free to use. **#Hack4Faith** challenges make use of the online free resources exclusively so the challenge hacks can be accessed and completed on any computer or mobile device with a web browser and access to the internet.  

Incorporating these study tools within the **#Hack4Faith** challenges is to provide the Holy Spirit more surface area for us to better understand what He wants to teach (John 14:26). Therefore, the challenge-based hacks may refer you to one or more Bible translations to help bring more insight or clarity to the concepts of the passage. In other cases you'll be directed to read a Bible commentary for further background and context. Or, you may do further research into the actual Greek words being used. These study tools will also be useful as you go on to study other parts of the Bible.
