## **#Hack4Faith Team Meet-ups**

One part of studying God's Word is the joy in sharing what you have learned and hearing what others have learned from the Holy Spirit's teaching. **#Hack4Faith** team meet-ups support this through a shared facilitation model -- a different team member is intended to facilitate each meet-up. Therefore, there is no designated "teacher" in a **#Hack4Faith** team. Questions that arise become opportunities for further research, discussion with others outside the team and then insights can be shared back with the team at the next meet-up. How cool!

This document provides some simple tips on team meet-ups, whether in-person or virtual.  

Proven practices:
- Identify a team of 4-7 that will complete the **#Hack4Faith** challenges
- Provide each potential team member with the **#Hack4Faith** URL so they can review and commit to the challenge-based hack
- Determine a consistent day and time for the team meet-ups
- Each team member completes the challenge-based hack prior to the team meet-up
    - Note - each challenge-based hack may take up to an hour to complete
- Team facilitator coordinates:
    - Opening/closing prayer
    - Who will collect any open questions for further research before the next meet-up
    - The clock to make sure all can share their "Discussion Preparation" content at a minimum during the meet-up (may appoint a time keeper)
    - Which team member will facilitate the next meet-up
    - Dividing up any open questions amongst the team for research and report-out at the next meet-up
    - Note: The team facilitator does not teach -- the Holy Spirit teaches through what each member shares. The facilitator enables discussion for hearing what the Holy Spirit is teaching through each team member.
