## **Challenge 10 - Colossians Retrospective**


**Challenge Scenario:**

Using the Agile methodology in software development, at the end of each "sprint" where within a fixed time duration a body of work has been completed, the team has a "retrospective." This is a dedicated time where the team discusses what worked, what didn't, what they learned, and this shapes the team's focus and actions for their ever-improving performance in the next sprint. Having now completed this **#Hack4Faith** in Colossians, it's time for a "retrospective" to help set up each of your team members for their next "sprint" in their faith walk. What have you learned that you want to focus on and share with the team to further establish your ever-improving walk of faith?


**Challenges:**
1. Think of this series of challenge-based hacks as building a scaffold or framework for how to research and study God's Word to further build your faith. Or possibly this study provided a lens through which now you "see" the scripture, Jesus, others, and God's heart for mankind more clearly. Whatever the case, take some time to reflect upon these challenges and review what you have journaled. 
    1. Challenge 1 - Historical Context
    1. Challenge 2 - Representing God's heart to others
    1. Challenge 3 - Praying for others
    1. Challenge 4 - The Job Description for a Savior
    1. Challenge 5 - Your Energy Source for Purpose
    1. Challenge 6 - A Treasure that makes you Debt Free
    1. Challenge 7 - Put Off - Put On
    1. Challenge 8 - Relationships - Home, Work, Others
    1. Challenge 9 - Standing Mature and Fully Confident

1. If you had 3 minutes to present what you've learned from the Letter to the Colossians to a trusted friend, what would be the title of your presentation and what would be your four bullet-points? *(As you prepare your bullet points, the following questions are to help stimulate your thinking, but it's not necessary for you to prepare a response for each one nor are these intended to be your bullet points.)*
    1. *What did I discover about Jesus that I did not know before?*
    1. *What did I discover about how God sees me that I did not know before?*
    1. *What did I discover about my purpose in God that I did not know before?*
    1. *What did I discover about my ability to spiritually impact the lives of others that I did not know before?*
    1. *What did I discover about my day-to-day relationships that I did not know before?*
    1. *In what ways has the Letter to the Colossians become a lens through which I now view life, scripture, God and others?*
